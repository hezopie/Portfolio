          <h4>Brainstorm </h4>
          <p>Brainstorming allows my team to evaluate all collected research and requirements. We can then begin to form conclusions and develop hypotheses. I try to include as many team members as I can in this step. Depending on what we are trying to solve, more often than not, everyone walks away with an assigned task or two. The more engaged team members are, the more vested they are.</p>
          <p>I have one steadfast rule for brainstorming: stay stocked up on sticky notes!</p>
          <p>I love to see team members sharing well beyond the brainstorming meeting (that’s when I know a meeting is a productive one). There are times, however, that the ideas are just not flowing. Then it’s time to send the team out for a break to get a cup of joe and try again later. <i class="fas fa-mug-hot" aria-hidden="true"></i> </p>

          <h4>Prototype and identify user experience issues</h4>
          <p dir="ltr">Producing a prototype showing all screens, flow, and interactivity, is essential. I like wireframes to represent every screen and click. Testing participants that match your products’ user persona is an invaluable means to gather insightful information.</p>
          <p dir="ltr">The wireframe also helps my team and clients understand the end product better. It provides a visual representation of the experience before the creative phase gets underway and accommodates changes much faster than a full UI design. It also serves as a clear guide for a functionality plan, setting milestones, and producing timelines.</p>
          <p dir="ltr">My biggest prototype challenge is making the approver take that deep dive in the wireframe (wearing the user’s shoes and not their own). I want them to go from start to finish and interact with every page and clickable element, and get the full-blown experience. <i class="fas fa-mouse-pointer fa-flip-horizontal"></i> </p>

            <h2>User Test</h2>
            <p>We try to get inside the users’ heads, but we all process information differently. The importance of never making assumptions and getting real people in front of our product (at the wireframe stage) is worth the extra time and effort. What may seem obvious to us is not necessarily intuitive for everyone.</p>
            <p>Testing ensures that the end product accomplishes what I intended. I used the form below to gather information from a group of testers engaging with our intranet interactive wireframe early on in the project. The feedback was valuable and helped guide us through some experience issues we hadn’t anticipated.              </p>
            <p>My goal is to produce a final product that guides the user quickly and effortlessly to get where they want to go, and where the business or brand wants them to go (that signup, purchase or other CTA).&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> </p>

          <h2>Mockup</h2>
          <p>Steadfast research and planning pave the way for the remainder of the project. Work can overlap, and progress steps up a notch.  From the wireframe, my development team can begin a functionality plan. At the same time, my design team can begin the UI mockup and once approved, development can begin.</p>
          <p>At this stage, for every hour of work, there are 2-3 hours of testing and QC (not as fun, but necessary). A collaborative team effort between UX, UI design, and development almost always results in notable success. A successful product launch may even warrant a victory happy dance (some may jump right up and do a standup dance. I tend to attempt a sit-at-my-desk-waving-my-arms kind of dance instead)! <i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i> </p>
